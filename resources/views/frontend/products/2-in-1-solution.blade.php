                                This potent blend fuses the power of two licensed, clinically proven hair loss medicines 
                                - Minoxidil and Finasteride. Our topical solution is designed for direct scalp application,
                                 thus typically reducing the side effects associated with oral consumption. This innovative
                                  spray provides a dual-action strategy: it actively blocks the hormone causing hair loss, 
                                  while simultaneously promoting scalp blood circulation to bolster follicle growth. It's 
                                  a straightforward, effective, and stylish solution for the modern gentleman taking command

                                designed specifically for the gents who prefer a no pill approach. This topical solution with 
                                Finasteride, directly targets hair loss where it begins - on the scalp.

                                Topical Finasteride is not just an alternative; it's a cutting-edge advancement 
                                in hair loss treatment. It delivers the active ingredient straight to the source,
                                 allowing for a more focused and direct impact. Notably, clinical studies found it
                                  to be effective whilst associated with fewer side effects when compared to oral.
                                   While the oral version remains a potent tool in our arsenal, our topical formula 
                                   offers ease of use and a potentially lower risk of side effects. It's yet another
                                    way Agent empowers the discerning gentleman with an array of sophisticated, high-performance
                                     solutions for managing hair loss."

                                For those gentlemen with longer hair or targeting specific thinning areas, the dropper is your tool of choice. It allows for a meticulous application, ensuring the solution has an accurate delivery to the exact regions you wish to target, bypassing the hair to work at the root of the problem, the scalp.

                                Meanwhile, those sporting shorter hair may find the spray offers better coverage and easier application. The spray disperses the solution over a wider area, ideal for a uniform scalp application. 

                                However, irrespective of the chosen method, it's essential to remember that the goal is to get the treatment onto the scalp, not the hair. Gentle massaging into the scalp ensures the formula's optimal performance.

                                Whether you opt for the dropper or the spray, it's all about selecting the method that suits your hair type and lifestyle best. Agent is committed to providing high-end, effective solutions tailored to the unique needs of the modern gentleman combating hair loss

                                  spray provides a dual-action strategy: it actively blocks the hormone causing hair loss, 
                                  while simultaneously promoting scalp blood circulation to bolster follicle growth. It's 
                                  a straightforward, effective, and stylish solution for the modern gentleman taking command

                                designed specifically for the gents who prefer a no pill approach. This topical solution with 
                                Finasteride, directly targets hair loss where it begins - on the scalp.

                                Topical Finasteride is not just an alternative; it's a cutting-edge advancement 
                                in hair loss treatment. It delivers the active ingredient straight to the source,
                                 allowing for a more focused and direct impact. Notably, clinical studies found it
                                  to be effective whilst associated with fewer side effects when compared to oral.
                                   While the oral version remains a potent tool in our arsenal, our topical formula 
                                   offers ease of use and a potentially lower risk of side effects. It's yet another

                    Finasteride applied topically is clinically proven to increase follicle counts in men with genetic forms of hair loss. It works by blocking DHT — the hormone created by testosterone.
                     When this effective solution is combined with Minoxidil to create a 2-in-1 solution, hair regrowth is hit from two angles: increased blood flow in the scalp and the blocking of the DHT hormone. Thinning hair doesn’t stand a chance!

                    There’s no doubt that oral Finasteride is very effective at reversing male pattern baldness over time. But for men concerned about possible side effects or that don’t want to take pills, the topical alternative may be a more attractive option. Although associated with fewer and milder side effects, Finasteride applied directly to the scalp still delivers very impressive results.

                    Agent's 2-in-1 hair loss solution, a unique blend of topical Finasteride and Minoxidil, is generally well-tolerated. While topical Finasteride hasn't been studied as extensively as its oral counterpart, it's shown promising results in treating male pattern baldness.
                Like all treatments, there's a potential for side effects. Previous studies found reduction in serum DHT, potentiating systemic side effects. However, systemic side effects usually associated with oral Finasteride, such as erectile dysfunction or reduced libido, were not reported in topical Finasteride studies. It's important to note that more research is needed to fully comprehend potential systemic risks.
                Minoxidil, the other active component in our 2-in-1 solution, may also cause side effects, including scalp irritation and unusual hair growth on areas other than the scalp. These are usually seen with over-application and are not common under normal usage.
                Local side effects, such as itching or irritation at the application site, have been observed in some studies of topical Finasteride and Minoxidil. With Agent's unique formulation, free from alcohol and PEG, the risk of local irritation is expected to be reduced.
                However, if side effects do occur, or if there are symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as rash, itching, or swelling, please seek medical attention promptly. If you're currently on oral Finasteride or dutasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), we recommend avoiding our topical Finasteride solution to prevent possible increased side effects.
                At Agent, we're committed to your wellbeing. Don't hesitate to reach out to our men's health professionals with any concerns or questions. We're here to support you on your journey to improved hair health."
